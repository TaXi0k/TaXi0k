## ✩°｡⋆⸜ TaXi0k ✮ ᯓ★:
I'm at the start of my programming journey. Right now I know a bit of Python, C++ and Java. I love playing and making games. I am currently trying to do my first more ambitious UE project - a pretty simple horror game. I also try to do my first Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge mod in my free time. Sadly I haven't completed any bigger projects yet. <br>
Besides programming I'm also trying to learn Blender... well I don't have much time to do it so I ended up on donut and one simple model but I guess it counts. <br>
