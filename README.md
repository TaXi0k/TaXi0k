I'm at the start of my programming journey. Right now I know a bit of Python, C++ and Java. <br>
I love playing and making games and am currently trying to do my first ambitious UE project - a simple horror game. <br>
I also try to do my first Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge mod in my free time. Sadly I haven't completed any bigger projects yet. <br>
